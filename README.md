# Overview

In this project, I used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify traffic signs. Specifically, I trained & validated multiple models using the traffic sign images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

After the models were trained and the best model was determined, I found additional German traffic sign images to further test the model's performance.

Work can be found the included [notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) found in this repo. An overall [write-up](writeup.html) can also be found in this repo where much of the information discussed in the main notebook is repeated.
